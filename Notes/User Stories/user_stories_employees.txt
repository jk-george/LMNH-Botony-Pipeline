Employees who want to monitor plant health

1. 
As an employee, I want to see a specific plant's real-time health data on the dashboard.
I want to see the current soil moisture and temperature and when it was last watered, 
for the plants that I have been assigned to,
so I can better manage my plants health?

2. As an employee, when I access the plant health monitoring system, 
I want to see alerts for plants with abnormal readings,
so I can prioritise which plants need more attention

3. As an employee, when I look at the historical data for a plant,
I want to see trends in soil moisture and temperature over time,
to help me identify trends/patterns that affect plant health

4. As an employee, when I see the plant's information, I want to see
details about the name, origin, and the botanist assigned to it,
so I can contact them if I need further advice/queries.
